# FGA
Feature Guidance attack for VLP models. The approach involves the ALBEF, TCL, CLIP, and BEiT3 models, as well as the VE (Visual Entailment), VG (Visual Grounding), VR (Visual Reasoning), VQA (Visual Question Answering), ZC (Zero-shot Classification), and ITR (Image-Text Retrieval) tasks.

The code is being organized.   
It is very stressful for one person to write all the code.   
I hope you can understand.   
If you really need it, you can contact me by email.   
I can provide the unorganized source code.
